# SEO Micro-Audit: Shine Mirrors Australia

**Website:** shinemirrors.com.au
**Date:** November 2025
**Business Type:** E-commerce (Mirrors Specialist)
**Location:** Australia-wide (mentions Perth, Sydney, Melbourne)

---

## Executive Summary

Shine Mirrors has experienced a **74% traffic decline** from its peak of ~21,000 monthly visitors in July 2024 to just 5,400 today. Despite being Australia's self-proclaimed "largest range" of mirrors, the site is losing ground to competitors. The low Domain Rating (13) and on-page SEO issues - particularly a non-optimized homepage H1 tag - are limiting growth potential.

**The opportunity:** This is a niche specialist competing against generalists. With focused SEO work, Shine Mirrors could dominate the Australian mirrors market.

## Critical On-Page Issues Found

### 1. Homepage H1 is Marketing Fluff, Not SEO
- **Current:** "Your SPACE, STYLE, & SHINE"
- **Problem:** Zero keywords, doesn't tell Google what the page is about
- **Business Translation:** "Your homepage headline is a tagline, not a signal to Google that you sell mirrors"
- **Fix:** "Mirrors Online Australia | Bathroom, LED & Decorative Mirrors"

### 2. Title Tag Wastes Characters on Phone Number
- **Category page:** "Bathroom Mirrors | Buy Online | Australia | Ph: 1300 797 708 — SHINE MIRRORS AUSTRALIA" (97 chars)
- **Problem:** Phone number uses 18 characters of valuable title space
- **Business Translation:** "You're putting your phone number where keywords should go - no one copies phone numbers from Google titles"

### 3. Homepage Title Has Emoji
- **Current:** Contains ♥ heart symbol
- **Problem:** Can cause display issues in search results, looks unprofessional
- **Business Translation:** "Some browsers and Google results show a broken character instead of a heart"

### 4. Multiple Popups & Widgets Slowing Site
- **Issue:** Email capture popup, chat widget, review widgets
- **Impact:** Slower page load = lower rankings, higher bounce rate
- **Business Translation:** "Every second of load time costs you customers - and Google notices"

## Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Common Keywords | Monthly Traffic | Domain Rating | Notes |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|-------|
| luxemirrors.com.au | 331 | 5,000 | 12 | Similar DR, similar traffic |
| sydneymirrors.com | 312 | 4,900 | 1 | Tiny DR but nearly matching you |
| mirrorwarehouse.com.au | 254 | 4,400 | 35 | Higher DR, less traffic |
| mirrorcity.com.au | 364 | 3,700 | 28 | Higher DR, less traffic |
| mirrorsdirect.com.au | 311 | 2,600 | 3 | Tiny DR, half your traffic |

### Key Insights
- **You're the market leader** (barely) - 5,400 vs competitors' 2,600-5,000
- **sydneymirrors.com has DR 1** but gets 4,900 visitors - proves on-page SEO matters more than backlinks in this niche
- **mirrorwarehouse.com.au has DR 35** (nearly 3x yours) but gets LESS traffic - you're punching above your weight
- **luxemirrors.com.au is your closest competitor** - identical DR 12, nearly identical traffic

### The Opportunity
This is a **fragmented market with no dominant player**. The top 5 competitors combined get ~20,000 monthly visits. With the right SEO push, Shine Mirrors could capture 40-50% market share.

## Recommended Email Approach

### Primary Angle: Market Leadership at Risk
They're currently #1 in the mirrors niche but competitors are closing in. The 74% traffic drop means they're losing their lead. Frame as "protect your market position."

### Secondary Angle: Quick Wins Available
The H1 tag and title tag fixes are simple. "Bathroom mirror" moving from #11 to page 1 could add 200+ monthly visitors with a single page optimization.

### Competitor Angle
sydneymirrors.com has DR of 1 (!) but nearly matches their traffic. Proves the problem isn't backlinks - it's on-page optimization.

### Tone: Encouraging, Opportunity-Focused
Unlike Bathroom Collective (emergency) or Bathware Direct (steady decline), this is about protecting and growing market leadership. More optimistic tone.
