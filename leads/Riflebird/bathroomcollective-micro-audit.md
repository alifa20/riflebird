## Critical On-Page Issues Found

### 1. Missing H1 Tag on Homepage
- **Issue:** Homepage has NO H1 heading tag

- **Business Translation:** "Your homepage doesn't tell Google what you sell"

### 2. Massive Image Alt Text Problem
- **125 images missing alt text** out of 295 total (42%)
- **Impact:** Products invisible in Google Image search
- **Business Translation:** "42% of your product images are invisible to Google - that's potential customers who will never find you when searching for bathroom products"

### 3. No Canonical Tags

## Top Performing Keywords (Currently)

**Note:** Almost all remaining traffic is from branded searches - a major red flag.

| Keyword | Position | Monthly Volume | Traffic | Type |
|---------|----------|----------------|---------|------|
| bathroom collective | #1 | 80 | 23 | Branded |
| mito bathrooms | #3 | 100 | 16 | Branded |
| shower rose | #16 | 1,600 | 6 | Generic |
| shower enclosure with base | #9 | 150 | 5 | Generic |

### Critical Observation
The site has **lost nearly all generic product keyword rankings**. When your only traffic comes from people who already know your brand name, you're invisible to new customers searching for products.

### Opportunity Keywords (Lost but Recoverable)
- **"shower rose"** (1,600 searches/mo) - Currently #16, was higher
- **"shower enclosure with base"** (150 searches/mo) - Currently #9
- **"narrow toilet"** - Lost positions, could recover
- **"small toilets"** - Lost positions, could recover

## Recommended Email Approach

### Primary Angle: Traffic Collapse Emergency
Lead with the **97% traffic collapse** - from 3,500 to 104 visitors. This is an emergency situation. They've essentially disappeared from Google. Frame as urgent recovery mission.

### Secondary Angle: Only Branded Traffic Left
Almost all remaining traffic is people searching "bathroom collective" or brand names. They've become **invisible to new customers** searching for products. This is existential for an e-commerce business.

### Competitor Comparison
- bathroomsalesdirect.com.au (similar DR 28) gets **96x more traffic**
- thebluespace.com.au gets **493x more traffic**
- Even recovering to 1/10th of thebluespace would be 5,000 visits vs 104

### Tone: Urgent, Professional, Diagnostic
They're a premium brand but in crisis. Lead with the severity but offer hope through diagnosis. Something specific caused this collapse - we can find it and fix it.

### Key Questions to Raise
- Did something change on the site in August-September 2024?
- Was there a site migration, redesign, or platform change?
- Have you checked Google Search Console for indexing issues?

- Image alt text optimization: 4-6 hours
- Homepage H1 and meta fixes: 1 hour
- Canonical tag implementation: 2 hours
- Content/keyword recovery strategy: 4-6 hours
