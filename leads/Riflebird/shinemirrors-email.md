## Variation A: Customer Perspective

**Subject:** I searched "bathroom mirror" - found you on page 2

Hi there,

I was searching for mirrors online and noticed something about Shine Mirrors.

For "bathroom mirror" - one of your core products with 3,400 monthly searches - you're ranking #11. That's page 2 of Google. Most shoppers never get there.

Meanwhile, you rank #3 for just "mirrors" (5,800 searches). So Google knows you sell mirrors - it just doesn't connect you to the specific products people are searching for.

Looking at your traffic, there's a pattern:
→ You went from 21,000 monthly visitors to 5,400 since July 2024 (74% drop)
→ "LED mirror" (3,400 searches) - you're #8, should be top 3
→ Your homepage headline "Your SPACE, STYLE, & SHINE" is great branding but tells Google nothing about mirrors

Here's the good news: you're still the market leader. luxemirrors.com.au, sydneymirrors.com, and mirrorcity.com.au are all getting less traffic than you. But they're closing the gap.

A few hours of on-page optimization could push "bathroom mirror" to page 1 and add 200+ monthly visitors from that single keyword alone.

Worth a quick call to discuss?

P.S. sydneymirrors.com has a Domain Rating of 1 (yours is 13) but gets nearly as much traffic. That proves the issue isn't backlinks - it's on-page optimization. Fixable stuff.

---

**Why This Works:** Opens with specific search scenario, positions them as market leader at risk, shows the fix is simple and quantifiable.

## Variation B: Competitor Comparison

**Subject:** sydneymirrors.com has DR 1 but nearly matches your traffic

Hi there,

Something interesting in the mirrors market:

Shine Mirrors has Domain Rating 13 and 642 referring domains. sydneymirrors.com has Domain Rating 1 - basically zero backlink authority.

Yet they're getting 4,900 monthly visitors to your 5,400. Nearly identical.

How? On-page SEO. Their pages are optimized for the keywords people actually search. Meanwhile, Shine Mirrors' homepage headline is "Your SPACE, STYLE, & SHINE" - great tagline, but Google has no idea you sell mirrors.

Here's the bigger picture:
→ Your traffic dropped 74% since July 2024 (21,000 to 5,400 visitors)
→ You rank #11 for "bathroom mirror" (3,400 monthly searches) - that's page 2
→ "LED mirror" (3,400 searches) - you're #8 when you should be top 3
→ Competitors are catching up while you're declining

The good news: you're still #1 in the market. And your backlink profile is actually solid - the problem is on-page basics.

Fixing your homepage H1, optimizing title tags, and pushing "bathroom mirror" to page 1 could add 500+ monthly visitors within weeks.

P.S. You rank #3 for "mirrors" (5,800 searches) - Google knows you exist. It's the product-specific keywords that need work.

---

**Why This Works:** The sydneymirrors.com comparison is shocking - proves domain authority isn't the issue. Creates urgency about competitors closing in.

---

## Variation C: Benefit-First

**Subject:** Your homepage H1 doesn't mention mirrors

Hi there,

Quick observation about shinemirrors.com.au:

Your homepage headline - the H1 tag that tells Google what the page is about - says "Your SPACE, STYLE, & SHINE."

Great tagline. But Google's algorithm is reading that and thinking "...so what do they sell?"

Meanwhile, you rank #3 for "mirrors" (5,800 searches/mo), proving Google knows your brand. The disconnect is between your branding and your SEO.

Here's what the data shows:
→ Traffic dropped 74% since July 2024 (21,000 → 5,400 visitors)
→ "Bathroom mirror" (3,400 searches) - you're #11, page 2
→ "LED mirror" (3,400 searches) - you're #8
→ Lost 145 keywords compared to previous period

And here's the opportunity:
→ You're still the traffic leader in the mirrors niche
→ Your closest competitor (luxemirrors.com.au) has the same Domain Rating but less traffic
→ A competitor with DR 1 (sydneymirrors.com) gets nearly as much traffic - proving on-page SEO is what matters here

Changing your homepage H1 takes 10 minutes. Optimizing your bathroom mirror page to hit page 1 might take 2 hours. These aren't massive projects.

Would it help if I sent over a prioritised fix list?

P.S. I can also share a case study showing how we helped another e-commerce site stop their dependence on paid ads. The before/after traffic chart tells the story - green spikes (expensive ads) vs orange line (sustainable organic growth).

**Why This Works:** Opens with a specific, verifiable issue (H1 tag), demonstrates technical knowledge, emphasizes quick wins and market leadership position.

## Recommendations

**Best Choice:** Variation B (Competitor Comparison)
- The sydneymirrors.com comparison is compelling and counterintuitive
- Shows the problem isn't authority (which feels hard to fix) but optimization (easy to fix)
- Market leadership framing is motivating, not alarming

**A/B Test:** Variations B and C
- B tests competitive/market positioning angle
- C tests specific technical issue + quick win angle
- Both emphasize they're still #1 (for now)

**Follow-Up:** If no response in 5 days:

>
> Short version: you're still the traffic leader, but the gap is closing. A few hours of on-page work could widen that lead instead of losing it.
>
> Happy to send the fix list regardless - might be useful even if you handle it in-house.

## Key Differentiators for This Prospect

1. **Market leader position:** Unlike other prospects, they're #1 (for now) - frame as protecting leadership
2. **Niche specialist:** Mirrors-only focus means targeted SEO can dominate
3. **Fragmented competition:** No dominant player - opportunity to pull away
4. **DR paradox:** Higher DR than some competitors who match their traffic - proves on-page is the issue
5. **Fixable issues:** H1 tag, title tags, page-specific optimization - not a site rebuild
6. **Strong foundation:** #3 for "mirrors", good local rankings - just needs refinement
