## Variation A: Customer Perspective

**Subject**: I was searching for bathroom renovations in Bayside...

Hi there,

I was searching "bathroom renovations bayside" yesterday (helping a mate find local suppliers) and honestly expected your showroom to dominate Google. Instead, you're on page 2 while Highgrove Bathrooms and The Blue Space are getting all the clicks.

Here's what caught my eye: you rank #12 for "bidet spray" - a product with 3,300 people searching for it monthly. That's 250+ potential customers not seeing your page every month.

Other quick wins I spotted:
• "Bath tub" ranking #19 → You're showing a pagination page instead of your actual products
• "Bathroom renovations bayside" #11 → Your money term, just needs a small push to page 1
• Domain strength: 2.4/100 while competitors sit at 30-70 → Google doesn't know you exist yet

**The kicker**: I pulled an Ahrefs chart for a bathroom client we helped last year. The green spikes show their paid ad traffic trying to compensate for poor rankings. After we fixed their SEO (orange line), they cut ad spend by 60% while growing overall traffic. Happy to share the screenshot - it tells the whole story.

Moving just those 8 keywords from page 2 to page 1 would nearly double your website traffic in 90 days. The fixes are honestly pretty straightforward - most would take 2-3 hours total.

Want me to send you the exact optimizations for your bidet spray page? No strings attached - just figured 20+ years in business deserves better than page 2 of Google.

P.S. Your product range is seriously impressive - criminal that someone searching "bidet spray Melbourne" sees your competitors first.

---

**Why This Works**:
Opens with relatable search behavior, positions you as a helpful local, and leads with their biggest quick-win opportunity. The paid ads case study creates urgency without being pushy, and the P.S. shows genuine appreciation for their business.

## Variation B: Competitor Comparison

**Subject**: Highgrove Bathrooms gets 74,787 visits/month. You get 451.

Hi there,

Blunt question: why is Highgrove Bathrooms getting 166x more website traffic than Bayside Bathroom & Kitchen Centre?

I compared your sites today. Here's what I found:

**Your site**:
• 451 monthly visitors
• Ranking for 394 keywords
• Domain strength: 2.4/100

**Highgrove**:
• 74,787 monthly visitors
• Ranking for 8,554+ keywords
• Domain strength: 45/100

The gap isn't your products or service - you've been in business 20+ years with a quality showroom. The gap is pure SEO.

Three examples that hurt:
• "Bidet spray" (3,300 searches/month) → You rank #12, they rank #3
• "Bath tub" (3,600 searches/month) → You're showing page 2 of results, they have a dedicated landing page
• "Bathroom renovations bayside" → You rank #11 for your own suburb while they outrank you

**Here's the opportunity**: I analyzed a similar bathroom business last year. Their Ahrefs chart showed constant paid ad spikes (green line) trying to compete with stronger organic competitors. After we fixed their SEO fundamentals, the orange line shows sustainable organic growth - no more ad dependency. Can share the visual if you're curious.

Moving your existing page 2 rankings to page 1 would add 400+ monthly visits in the next quarter. I can send you the exact fixes for free - would take you maybe 2-3 hours to implement.

P.S. Reece and Tradelink are giants, but Highgrove and The Blue Space are your real competitors. You can absolutely compete with them - you just need the SEO foundation they have.

---

**Why This Works**:
Creates competitive urgency with specific numbers, positions you as the expert who's done the research, and offers immediate value. The direct comparison shows you've done your homework and makes the opportunity tangible.

## Variation C: Benefit-First

**Subject**: Quick question - are you paying for Google Ads?

Hi there,

Random question: are you running Google Ads to make up for organic rankings?

I ask because I pulled your site data today and saw something interesting. You're ranking #12 for "bidet spray" - a product 3,300 people search for monthly. That's position #12 out of millions of pages, which means you're *this close* to page 1.

If you're paying for clicks on that keyword, you're spending roughly $2-4 per click when you could own that traffic organically.

**What I found**:
• 8 keywords where you rank #11-20 (page 2)
• Each one represents 20-250 potential customers monthly
• Combined: 400+ visits you're missing every month
• Fixes: Mostly 30-minute optimizations per page

We helped a bathroom supplier last year cut their ad spend by 60% after fixing these exact issues. I have the Ahrefs chart showing the before/after - the green spikes (paid traffic) vs the orange line (organic growth) is pretty dramatic. The difference between renting traffic and owning it.

Want me to send you the specific fixes for your top 3 quick-win pages? No pitch, no strings - just the actual optimizations you'd need to make. Your call if you want to implement them yourself or chat about help.

Either way, 20+ years in business shouldn't mean page 2 of Google for your own products.

P.S. If you're not running ads, even better - these fixes would be pure upside with zero cannibalization of existing paid traffic.

**Why This Works**:
Opens with curiosity and a financial angle that resonates with business owners. The "renting vs owning" traffic metaphor is powerful, and offering free fixes builds immediate trust. Works whether they're running ads or not.

## Recommendations

**Best Choice**: **Variation C (Benefit-First)**
The Google Ads angle creates immediate financial relevance, and the "renting vs owning traffic" case study visual will resonate with a business owner who's been around 20+ years. The friendly tone matches their local showroom vibe while the specific numbers show credibility.

**A/B Test**: Send Variation C to the owner/decision-maker and Variation A to the marketing manager (if they have one). The customer perspective approach works well for marketing staff who think about user experience.

**Follow-Up Timeline**:
- Day 3: If no response, send the bidet spray page fix as promised (builds trust)
- Day 7: Follow up with "Did you get a chance to look at the fix I sent? Also found 2 more quick wins for your bath tub page if you're interested"
- Day 14: Send Variation B (competitor comparison) as a different angle

**Case Study Screenshot Usage**:
Since they said yes to including it, make sure to reference `leads/Riflebird/result.jpg` when they reply. Frame it as:
- "Here's that chart I mentioned - tells the whole story in one visual"
- Be ready to explain: Green = paid traffic spikes (temporary), Orange = organic growth (sustainable)
- Cost angle: "This client was spending $2K+/month on ads just to maintain those green spikes. Now they own the traffic."

## Key Insights from Audit

**Strongest Selling Points**:
1. The #12 ranking for "bidet spray" is a goldmine - low-hanging fruit with massive volume
2. They're already competitive (20+ years, physical showroom) - just invisible online
3. Eight page 2 rankings = nearly double traffic with minimal effort
4. Competitor gap is fixable (they're not competing with Amazon, just local businesses)

**Avoid Mentioning**:
- Domain Rating numbers without context (sounds too technical)
- Backlink counts (jargon unless translated to "Google trust")
- Anything about crawling, indexing, schema markup

**Emotional Triggers**:
- Frustration: "20 years in business but page 2 of Google"
- Competition: "Highgrove getting 166x more traffic"
- Opportunity cost: "250+ potential customers monthly not seeing your page"
- Financial: "Paying $2-4 per click when you could own that traffic"
