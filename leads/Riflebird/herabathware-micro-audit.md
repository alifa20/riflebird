# SEO Micro-Audit: Hera Bathware

**Website:** herabathware.com.au
**Date:** November 2025
**Business Type:** Bathroom Supplies Retailer (E-commerce + Physical Showrooms)
**Location:** Melbourne, VIC (2 showrooms: Brooklyn & Moorabbin)

---

## Executive Summary

Hera Bathware has experienced a **62-70% traffic decline** from its peak of ~11,600 monthly visitors in mid-2024 to just 4,400 today. As a Melbourne-based business with 2 physical showrooms, they have strong local SEO potential that's being underutilised. Critical issues include missing H1 tags, a completely lost high-value keyword ("led mirror" - 3,100 searches/mo), and competitors with similar products getting 3x more traffic.

**The opportunity:** Local Melbourne focus + physical showrooms = trust advantage over pure e-commerce competitors. SEO fixes could dominate "bathroom [product] Melbourne" searches.

## Traffic Decline Analysis

**Current Traffic:** 4,400 visits/month

---

## Critical On-Page Issues Found

### 1. Homepage Missing H1 Tag
- **Current:** No clear H1 - first heading is a product name ("Seoul Ergonomic Toilet")
- **Problem:** Google doesn't know what the homepage is about
- **Business Translation:** "Your homepage headline is about one toilet instead of telling Google you're Melbourne's bathroom supplier"
- **Fix:** "Bathroom Supplies Melbourne | Vanities, Showers & Toilets | 2 Showrooms"

### 2. Lost High-Value Keyword Completely
- **Keyword:** "led mirror" (3,100 monthly searches)
- **Previous position:** #5
- **Current position:** LOST (not ranking)
- **Impact:** This single keyword was likely driving 200+ monthly visitors
- **Business Translation:** "You used to show up when people searched 'led mirror' - now you're invisible for one of your products"

### 3. Category Pages Lack H1 Tags
- **Issue:** Collection pages don't have proper semantic H1 headings
- **Impact:** Google doesn't understand what each category page is about
- **Business Translation:** "Your Vanities page doesn't clearly tell Google it's about vanities"

### 4. Title Tag Repetition
- **Current homepage:** "Bathroom Supplies Melbourne | Bathroom Shops Melbourne | Hera Bathware"
- **Problem:** "Melbourne" appears twice, wasting characters
- **Fix:** "Bathroom Supplies Melbourne | Vanities, Showers, Toilets | Hera Bathware"

## Recommended Email Approach

### Primary Angle: Lost Traffic + Lost Keyword
Lead with the **62% decline** AND the specific "led mirror" keyword loss. This is tangible - they can check it themselves. A single keyword recovery could add 200+ monthly visitors.

### Secondary Angle: Local Competitor Comparison
arova.com.au (also Melbourne with showrooms) gets 3.3x more traffic. Same market, same model, very different results. This creates local competitive urgency.

### Local SEO Angle
They have 2 showrooms but only 151 local keywords ranking. There's a whole category of "bathroom [product] Melbourne" and "bathroom supplies [suburb]" searches they're missing.

### Tone: Practical, Local-Business Focused
This is a Melbourne business with physical stores - not a faceless e-commerce operation. More personal, practical tone. Mention the showrooms as an advantage.
