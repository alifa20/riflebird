## Variation A: Customer Perspective

**Subject:** I searched "shower rose" and couldn't find Bathroom Collective

Hi there,

I was researching bathroom suppliers in Sydney and noticed something concerning about your Google visibility.

When I search for products you sell - like "shower rose" or "shower enclosure" - Bathroom Collective doesn't appear on page one. But I know you carry premium brands like Hansgrohe and Duravit that customers are actively searching for.

Looking at the data, your site went from ~3,500 monthly Google visitors to just 104 - a 97% drop since mid-2024. That's not a slow decline; something specific happened.

Here's what stands out:
→ Almost all your remaining traffic is people searching "Bathroom Collective" directly
→ You've lost 232 product keywords in the past few months
→ Competitors like bathroomsalesdirect.com.au (similar size) are getting 96x more traffic

The good news: this pattern suggests a fixable technical issue rather than a permanent problem. I'd like to run a free diagnostic to identify exactly what caused the collapse.

Would you have 15 minutes this week for a quick call? I can share what I've found and outline the recovery path.

P.S. I can also share a case study showing how we helped another retailer stop their reliance on paid ads. The green spikes in their chart show expensive ad spend trying to compensate for poor organic rankings - the orange line shows what sustainable organic growth looks like after we fixed their SEO.

**Why This Works:** Opens with a relatable search experience, positions the problem as urgent but solvable, offers free value (diagnostic) rather than a sales pitch.

## Variation B: Competitor Comparison

**Subject:** bathroomsalesdirect.com.au is getting 96x your Google traffic

Hi there,

I've been analysing the bathroom supply market in Australia and noticed something that might concern you.

bathroomsalesdirect.com.au - a competitor with similar domain authority to yours - is currently getting 10,000 monthly visitors from Google. Bathroom Collective is getting 104.

That's not a typo. They're getting 96x more organic traffic despite being a comparable size operation.

Here's what the data shows for bathroomcollective.com.au:
→ Traffic collapsed 97% since August 2024 (from 3,500 to 104 visits)
→ You've lost 232 keywords - most of your product visibility is gone
→ The only searches finding you now are people typing "Bathroom Collective" directly

Meanwhile, thebluespace.com.au gets 51,000 monthly visitors. Reece gets 183,000. Even a fraction of that traffic would transform your online sales.

Something specific triggered this collapse - likely a technical issue or algorithm change. I'd like to offer a free 30-minute diagnostic to pinpoint the cause and map out recovery.

Interested?

P.S. Your showroom and consultation services are genuine advantages over pure-online competitors. But customers need to find you on Google first.

**Why This Works:** Creates competitive urgency with specific numbers, positions the 97% drop as abnormal (not industry-wide), offers concrete next step.

## Variation C: Benefit-First

**Subject:** Quick question about your August 2024 traffic drop

Hi there,

Did something change on your website around August-September 2024?

I ask because I've been reviewing bathroom suppliers' SEO performance, and Bathroom Collective shows one of the sharpest traffic declines I've seen - 97% drop from ~3,500 monthly visitors to just 104 today.

That's not typical market fluctuation. Something specific happened.

The pattern suggests either:
- A site update that accidentally blocked Google
- A platform migration that broke indexing
- A structural change that confused search engines

Whatever the cause, the impact is significant:
→ You've lost 232 ranking keywords
→ 96% of remaining traffic is branded searches (people who already know you)
→ New customers searching "shower enclosure" or "bathroom vanity" aren't finding you

The premium brands you carry - Hansgrohe, Duravit, Astra Walker - deserve to be visible. And with your showroom, consultation services, and price-match guarantee, you'd convert that traffic well.

I'd like to run a free diagnostic to identify the exact cause. It takes about an hour on my end, and I'll share everything I find - no strings attached.

Worth a conversation?
