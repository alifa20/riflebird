# Cold Email Variations for Hera Bathware

**Audit Source:** leads/Riflebird/herabathware-micro-audit.md
**Industry:** Bathroom Supplies (E-commerce + 2 Physical Showrooms)
**Location:** Melbourne, VIC (Brooklyn & Moorabbin)

**Top Issues (Business Language):**
1. 62% traffic decline - from 11,600 to 4,400 monthly visitors since mid-2024
2. Completely lost "led mirror" ranking (3,100 monthly searches) - was #5, now invisible
3. Homepage H1 is about one toilet instead of telling Google you're Melbourne's bathroom supplier
4. arova.com.au (also Melbourne with showrooms) gets 3.3x your traffic

## Variation A: Customer Perspective

**Subject:** I searched "led mirror" - Hera Bathware used to show up

Hi there,

I was looking at Melbourne bathroom suppliers and noticed something about Hera Bathware.

For "led mirror" - a keyword with 3,100 monthly searches - you used to rank #5. Now you don't appear at all.

That single keyword was likely driving 200+ visitors per month to your site. Now those customers are going to Temple & Webster, Amazon, and your competitors instead.

Looking at the bigger picture:
→ Your traffic dropped 62% since mid-2024 (11,600 to 4,400 monthly visitors)
→ arova.com.au (also Melbourne, also has showrooms) is getting 3.3x your traffic
→ Your homepage headline is about a "Seoul Ergonomic Toilet" instead of telling Google you're Melbourne's bathroom supplier

The good news: you're still strong for shower products (#1-3 for various shower base terms). And you have something arova.com.au doesn't - two showrooms where Melbourne customers can see your products in person.

That local advantage isn't being used in your SEO. Only 151 of your ranking keywords mention Melbourne or local areas.

Would a 15-minute call be useful? I can walk through exactly what I found and the priority order for fixes.

P.S. We're also Melbourne-based. Happy to stop by the Brooklyn or Moorabbin showroom if that's easier.

**Why This Works:** Opens with specific lost keyword, quantifies the opportunity, uses local connection (Melbourne-to-Melbourne), offers in-person meeting option.

## Variation B: Competitor Comparison

**Subject:** arova.com.au gets 3.3x your Google traffic (same model, same city)

Hi there,

Quick question: what's arova.com.au doing differently?

They're Melbourne-based with multiple showrooms. You're Melbourne-based with 2 showrooms (Brooklyn and Moorabbin). Same business model, same market.

But they're getting 14,300 monthly visitors from Google. Hera Bathware is getting 4,400.

That's 3.3x more potential customers finding them instead of you.

Here's what the data shows:
→ Your traffic dropped 62% since mid-2024 (11,600 → 4,400 visitors)
→ You completely lost your "led mirror" ranking (3,100 monthly searches) - was #5, now gone
→ Your homepage H1 is a product name ("Seoul Ergonomic Toilet") not a keyword signal
→ Only 151 of your keywords target Melbourne/local searches

Meanwhile, your shower base rankings are solid (#1-3 for multiple terms). The foundation is there - it's the basics that need attention.

Here's the local opportunity you're missing:
→ "bathroom vanities melbourne" - you're #7, should be #1-3
→ "bathroom showroom melbourne" - not ranking
→ "bathroom supplies [Brooklyn/Moorabbin]" - not targeting

With 2 physical locations, you should own local bathroom searches in Melbourne. That's traffic arova.com.au can't easily take from you.

P.S. Your Brooklyn showroom is 15 minutes from our office. Happy to meet in person if that's helpful.

**Why This Works:** Direct local competitor comparison creates urgency. Emphasizes their physical showroom advantage that's being underutilised. Local-to-local business connection.

---

## Variation C: Benefit-First

**Subject:** Your homepage H1 is about one toilet

Hi there,

Quick observation about herabathware.com.au:

Your homepage H1 tag - the headline that tells Google what the page is about - says "Seoul Ergonomic Toilet."

That's one product out of hundreds. Google reads that and thinks "this page is about a toilet" instead of "this is Melbourne's bathroom supplies destination."

It's a 10-minute fix. But it's one of several issues I spotted:

**What's hurting you:**
→ Traffic dropped 62% since mid-2024 (11,600 → 4,400 visitors)
→ You completely lost "led mirror" ranking (3,100 searches/mo) - was #5
→ Category pages missing H1 tags
→ Only 151 local keywords ranking despite 2 Melbourne showrooms

**What's working:**
→ #1-3 for multiple shower base/tray terms
→ "hera bathware" brand searches = 200/month
→ Strong position for "laundry bench" (#2)

**The local opportunity you're missing:**
You have something pure e-commerce competitors don't - two showrooms where customers can touch and see products before buying. But your SEO doesn't leverage that.

"Bathroom vanities melbourne" - you're #7
"Bathroom showroom melbourne" - not ranking
"Bathroom supplies brooklyn/moorabbin" - not targeting

These are customers looking to visit a store. You have stores. They should find you.

Would it help if I sent over a prioritised fix list?

P.S. I helped another Melbourne retailer shift from paid ad dependency to sustainable organic traffic. Happy to share the before/after - the difference between renting traffic (green spikes) and owning it (orange line) is dramatic.

---

**Why This Works:** Opens with specific, verifiable issue, balances problems with positives, emphasizes the unique local showroom advantage they should leverage.

## Recommendations

**Best Choice:** Variation B (Competitor Comparison)
- arova.com.au comparison is direct and local - same city, same business model
- Emphasizes the showroom advantage they're not using
- Local-to-local business angle (Riflebird Melbourne to Hera Melbourne)

**A/B Test:** Variations B and C
- B tests local competitive urgency (arova getting 3.3x traffic)
- C tests specific technical issue + local opportunity angle
- Both emphasize the physical showroom advantage

## Key Differentiators for This Prospect

1. **Local Melbourne business:** Use Riflebird's Melbourne base as connection point
2. **Physical showrooms:** Unique advantage over e-commerce - should dominate local searches
3. **Lost specific keyword:** "led mirror" drop is concrete and verifiable
4. **Same-model competitor:** arova.com.au comparison is direct and relevant
5. **Local SEO gap:** Only 151 local keywords vs 1,600 total = massive opportunity
6. **In-person meeting option:** Can offer to visit showroom - differentiates from generic outreach
7. **Strong foundation exists:** #1-3 for shower products shows SEO CAN work for them
