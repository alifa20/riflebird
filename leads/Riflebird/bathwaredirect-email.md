## Variation A: Customer Perspective

**Subject:** I searched "shower head" and found you on page 2

Hi there,

I was looking for bathroom suppliers and searched "shower head" - one of the biggest keywords in your industry (14,000 monthly searches in Australia).

Bathware Direct showed up at position 7. Your competitors Temple & Webster, Bunnings, and The Blue Space took the top spots.

That single keyword alone could be driving 500+ extra visitors per month if you ranked in the top 3 instead of position 7.

Looking at your overall traffic, there's a bigger pattern:
→ Your site went from 57,500 monthly visitors to 12,800 since mid-2024
→ That's a 78% decline - roughly 44,700 lost visitors per month
→ Highgrove Bathrooms (similar products, DR 47) is getting 5.6x your traffic

I checked your site and found some quick fixes:
→ Your homepage title is just "Home | Bathware Direct" (23 characters) - you're using 1/3 of your Google billboard
→ Category pages like "Toilet Suites" are missing H1 tags entirely
→ These are 2-3 hour fixes that can start recovering traffic immediately

Would a 15-minute call be useful? I can walk through exactly what I found and the priority order for fixes.

P.S. You're already #1 for "1000mm vanity" and #2 for "nero tapware" - the foundation is there. It's the basics that need attention.

---

**Why This Works:** Opens with a specific, relatable search scenario, quantifies the opportunity, shows the fix is achievable (not a complete rebuild).

## Variation B: Competitor Comparison

**Subject:** Highgrove Bathrooms gets 5.6x your Google traffic

Hi there,

Quick question: what's Highgrove Bathrooms doing differently?

They have DR 47 vs your DR 33 - not a massive gap. But they're getting 72,200 monthly organic visitors while Bathware Direct gets 12,800.

That's 5.6x more potential customers finding them instead of you.

Here's what the data shows for bathwaredirect.com.au:
→ Traffic dropped 78% since mid-2024 (57,500 → 12,800 visitors)
→ Homepage title is "Home | Bathware Direct" - tells Google nothing about what you sell
→ Category pages missing H1 tags - Google doesn't know your Toilet Suites page is about toilets
→ You rank #7 for "shower head" (14,000 searches/mo) while competitors take the top spots

The gap isn't your domain authority or backlinks - those are solid (787 referring domains). It's on-page optimization.

The good news: these are fixable in days, not months. A few hours of work on title tags, H1s, and meta descriptions could start reversing that traffic decline.

P.S. You're already winning for specific products - #1 for "1000mm vanity", #2 for "nero tapware". The bones are good; it's the basics that need work.

**Why This Works:** Creates competitive urgency with a specific rival, shows the problem is solvable (not a fundamental weakness), emphasizes quick fixes over lengthy projects.

## Variation C: Benefit-First

**Subject:** Your "Toilet Suites" page has no H1 tag

Hi there,

I was auditing bathroom supply sites and noticed something on bathwaredirect.com.au that's likely costing you traffic.

Your Toilet Suites category page - one of your main product pages - has no H1 heading tag. Google literally doesn't know the page is about toilet suites.

It's a 5-minute fix. But it's one of several basic SEO elements that seem to be missing across the site.

Here's the bigger picture:
→ Traffic has dropped 78% since mid-2024 (57,500 to 12,800 monthly visitors)
→ Homepage title is just "Home | Bathware Direct" - uses 1/3 of available space
→ Meta descriptions aren't rendering properly
→ You rank #7 for "shower head" (14,000 monthly searches) when you could rank top 3

Meanwhile, Highgrove Bathrooms (similar products) gets 5.6x your traffic, and The Blue Space gets 4x.

The good news: your backlink profile is solid (787 referring domains, DR 33). The problem is on-page fundamentals - exactly the kind of thing that responds quickly to fixes.

Would it help if I sent over a prioritised list of what to fix first?

P.S. I helped a retailer in a similar situation cut their reliance on paid ads. Happy to share a before/after showing their transition from expensive ad spikes (green) to sustainable organic growth (orange).

**Why This Works:** Opens with a specific, concrete problem (missing H1), demonstrates technical expertise, offers immediate value (prioritised fix list).

## Recommendations

**Best Choice:** Variation C (Benefit-First)
- The specific H1 issue is concrete and verifiable
- Shows technical expertise without being overwhelming
- Offers value upfront (prioritised fix list)
- Includes case study reference for credibility

**A/B Test:** Variations B and C
- B tests competitive urgency (Highgrove comparison)
- C tests technical expertise (specific H1 issue)
- Both appropriate for an e-commerce business

**Follow-Up:** If no response in 5 days:

> Subject: Re: Your "Toilet Suites" page has no H1 tag
>
> Hi - following up on my note about the missing H1 tags and traffic decline.
>
> Here's the quick version: your traffic dropped 78% but your backlink profile is solid. That usually means on-page issues - exactly what I spotted.
>
> Happy to send the fix list regardless. Sometimes an outside perspective helps.

## Key Differentiators for This Prospect

1. **Not a crash, a bleed:** 78% decline is serious but gradual - implies fixable issues, not catastrophic failure
2. **Strong foundation:** DR 33, 787 backlinks - they've built authority, just not using it well
3. **Specific wins exist:** #1 for "1000mm vanity", #2 for "nero tapware" - proves they CAN rank
4. **Clear competitors to reference:** Highgrove (5.6x) and The Blue Space (4x) as benchmarks
5. **Shopify platform:** Likely familiar with apps/tools, may be receptive to technical fixes
