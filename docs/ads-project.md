PMAX Campaign Manager - Project Overview
What We're Building
A dead-simple Google Ads dashboard that lets non-experts manage Performance Max campaigns without needing to understand all the complexity of Google Ads. Think of it as "Google Ads for humans" - specifically focused only on PMAX campaigns.

The Big Problem We're Solving
Current situation:

Small agencies and business owners struggle with Google Ads - it's overwhelming
The Google Ads interface has hundreds of options, most irrelevant to PMAX
Setting up a PMAX campaign requires understanding conversion tracking, asset groups, audience signals, bid strategies, etc.
People either hire expensive agencies or give up

Our solution:

Strip away 90% of Google Ads complexity
Use an AI chatbot to guide campaign creation (feels like talking to an expert)
Show only the metrics that actually matter
Make it impossible to mess up


Who Is This For?

Small marketing agencies (2-10 people) managing ads for clients but lacking Google Ads experts
Business owners who want to run their own ads but find Google Ads intimidating
Marketing coordinators who got thrown into managing ads without training
Anyone who just wants their PMAX campaigns to work without a PhD in digital marketing


Core Features (The Stuff Users Actually Do)
1. Dashboard - See How Campaigns Are Doing
When you log in, you see:

3 big numbers at the top:

How much money you've spent today
How many conversions (sales/leads) you got
Your ROAS (return on ad spend - basically, are you making money?)


A simple graph showing spend vs conversions over the last month
List of all your campaigns with status, budget, and performance

That's it. No clutter. You can immediately see "am I making money or losing money?"

2. Create a Campaign - The Magic Part
Instead of filling out complex forms, you have a conversation with an AI.
You click "Create Campaign" and a chat window opens. The AI asks you questions one at a time:
AI: "Hi! Let's create your campaign. What should we call it?"
You: "Summer Sale 2025"

AI: "Great! What's your main goal?"
[3 buttons appear: Get Sales | Get Leads | Get Traffic]
You: *clicks Get Sales*

AI: "Perfect! What's your daily budget? I recommend $75-100 to start."
You: "$100"

AI: "Where should we show your ads?"
You: "United States"

AI: "What counts as a conversion for you?"
[Toggles appear: Purchase | Lead Form | Sign Up | Call]
You: *toggles on Purchase*

AI: "Now upload some images of your products..."
You: *drag and drop 10 images*

AI: "Nice! Now write some headlines..."
You: Types headlines like "Free Shipping Today" "50% Off Summer Sale"

AI: "Here's everything we set up. Ready to launch?"
[Shows summary]
You: *clicks Launch*

AI: "🎉 You're live! Check back in a few hours for data."
Why this is brilliant:

No confusing forms with 47 fields
AI explains what everything means in plain English
Gives you examples and recommendations
Validates everything so you can't mess it up
Feels like you have an expert helping you


3. Campaign Details - Deep Dive on One Campaign
Click any campaign to see:
Performance metrics:

Impressions, Clicks, Conversions, Cost per conversion, ROAS
Each shows if it's getting better or worse

Where your ads are showing:

A pie chart breaking down: YouTube, Search, Shopping, Display, Gmail, Maps
Table showing which channels perform best
"Hey, YouTube is crushing it with 6x ROAS!"

What people are searching:

See actual search terms that triggered your ads
Find irrelevant ones and exclude them with one click
Discover new opportunities

How your ads are performing:

Which headlines work best
Which images get clicks
Which descriptions convert
Replace the duds


4. Alerts & Suggestions
A sidebar that tells you important stuff:

"⚠️ Your budget is almost gone today"
"💡 Add more image variety - campaigns with 15+ images perform 30% better"
"🔴 This asset group has terrible ROAS - pause it?"

You can fix things with one click right from the alert.

5. Settings Made Simple
Budget:

Big +/- buttons to adjust daily budget
Shows if you're on track or overspending
"At this rate you'll spend $X this month"

Bidding Strategy:

3 simple options with plain English explanations
"Maximize Conversions" (recommended - just get me sales)
"Target ROAS" (I want 4x return minimum)
"Maximize Conversion Value" (focus on big orders)

Audience Hints:

Tell Google who to target (but it's flexible, not strict)
Age ranges, interests, uploaded customer lists
Google's AI finds similar people

Negative Keywords:

Exclude irrelevant searches
"jobs" "careers" "free" "DIY" etc.
AI suggests obvious ones to exclude


Key Design Principles
1. Conversational Over Forms
Traditional software makes you fill out forms. We let you chat with an AI that asks questions naturally and explains everything.
2. Show Only What Matters
Google Ads has 200+ metrics. We show the 6 that actually matter for PMAX. Everything else is hidden or automated.
3. Explain Like I'm Five
No jargon. Instead of "CPM" we say "cost per 1000 impressions." Tooltips everywhere.
4. Make Fixes Easy
See a problem? Fix it right there with one click. No digging through menus.
5. Color-Coded Everything

Green = good (high ROAS, on budget)
Red = bad (low performance, overspending)
Yellow = warning (declining, needs attention)

Technical Requirements (What the Developer Needs to Build)
Core Integrations:

Google Ads API - to create campaigns, fetch data, update settings
AI API (Claude or ChatGPT) - for the conversational campaign builder
File uploads - for image/video assets
Database - to store user accounts, campaign settings, preferences

Key Screens to Build:

Dashboard (home page)
Chat interface for campaign creation
Single campaign detail view
Channel performance breakdown
Search terms table
Asset performance view
Settings pages
Alerts sidebar

Data We Show:

Campaign metrics: spend, conversions, ROAS, CTR, CPC, impressions, clicks
Channel breakdown by platform
Search term performance
Asset ratings and performance
Budget pacing
Trend arrows (up/down from last period)


Success Metrics (How We Know It's Working)

Agencies create campaigns 5x faster than in Google Ads
80% campaign completion rate (vs 40% in Google Ads where people give up)
Users with zero Google Ads experience can create a campaign in under 10 minutes
Support tickets drop by 70% because the UI explains itself
Campaign performance equals or beats what they'd get from Google Ads directly


Future Enhancements (Not in V1)

Multi-campaign management (bulk edits)
A/B testing assets
Automated rules ("pause if ROAS drops below 2x")
White-label for agencies
Template campaigns
Integration with Shopify/WooCommerce for automatic product feeds
Mobile app
Competitor analysis
Budget optimization across campaigns


Monetization Ideas

Freemium: Free for 1 campaign, $49/mo for unlimited
Per-Campaign: $29/mo per active campaign
Percentage of Spend: 3% of ad spend as management fee
Agency Tier: $299/mo for agencies managing client accounts
White Label: $999/mo for agencies to rebrand as their own tool


Why This Will Work
Market demand is huge:

Google Ads is a $200B+ market
PMAX is Google's future (they're pushing everyone to it)
Most businesses can't afford $3K/mo agency fees
Current alternatives (AdEspresso, Optmyzr) are still too complex

We're solving real pain:

Agencies waste 10+ hours/week on campaign setup
Business owners pay agencies because they can't figure it out themselves
Google's UI hasn't meaningfully improved for non-experts in 10 years

Differentiation:

Only tool focused exclusively on PMAX
Only tool using conversational AI for setup
Simplest possible interface - we're the Stripe of Google Ads
