## Historical Performance Trends

### Domain Rating Growth
Life Interiors has shown relative stability in domain authority over the past year:

| Date | Domain Rating |
|------|--------------|
| Jan 2025 | 53 |
| Feb 2025 | 55 |
| Mar 2025 | 56 (peak) |
| Apr 2025 | 56 |
| May 2025 | 56 |
| Jun 2025 | 56 |
| Jul 2025 | 55 |
| Aug 2025 | 55 |
| Sep 2025 | 55 |
| Oct 2025 | 53 |
| Nov 2025 | 54 (current) |

**Analysis**: DR peaked at 56 in March-June 2025, then gradually decreased to 53 by October before recovering slightly to 54. This suggests some backlink losses or quality degradation. A slight decline is normal but monitoring is recommended.

### Referring Domains Growth
Strong backlink acquisition over the past 9 months:

| Date | Referring Domains | Monthly Growth |
|------|------------------|----------------|
| Feb 2025 | 903 | - |
| Mar 2025 | 1,003 | +100 (+11.1%) |
| Apr 2025 | 1,040 | +37 (+3.7%) |
| May 2025 | 1,071 | +31 (+3.0%) |
| Jun 2025 | 1,146 | +75 (+7.0%) |
| Jul 2025 | 1,257 | +111 (+9.7%) |
| Aug 2025 | 1,344 | +87 (+6.9%) |
| Sep 2025 | 1,379 | +35 (+2.6%) |
| Oct 2025 | 1,425 | +46 (+3.3%) |
| Nov 2025 | 1,405 | -20 (-1.4%) |

**Analysis**:
- **Strong Growth Phase**: From 903 to 1,425 referring domains (+58% growth from Feb to Oct 2025)
- **Best Month**: July 2025 with +111 new referring domains
- **Recent Concern**: November saw a net loss of 20 referring domains (some links lost or devalued)
- **Average Growth**: ~50 new domains per month during peak months

**Recommendation**: The slight loss in November should be investigated. Check for:
- Lost links from high-authority sites
- Broken backlinks that need reclamation
- Competitors who may be running aggressive link building campaigns

### Key Observations

1. **Domain Authority Stability**: DR hovering between 53-56 shows established authority but room for growth
2. **Backlink Velocity**: Strong link acquisition rate (500+ new domains in 9 months) but recent slowdown
3. **Growth Correlation**: DR peaked when backlink growth was strongest (Mar-Jun), suggesting quality links were acquired
4. **Current Status**: Slight decline in both metrics suggests need for renewed link building efforts

**Historical Context Note**:
Unfortunately, organic traffic history data is restricted in the current Ahrefs API access level. However, based on the current 52,241 monthly visits and stable domain authority, we can infer:
- Traffic has likely remained relatively stable
- The strong backlink growth (Feb-Oct) should translate to traffic increases in coming months (ranking improvements take 3-6 months typically)
- Focus should be on capitalizing on the authority gains by improving on-page optimization
