## Email Version 1: Direct Technical Approach

**Subject:** One Six Eight London invisible for "designer wall clocks Melbourne"

**To:** [Contact Name/info@onesixeightlondon.com.au]

Hi [Name],

I was analyzing homewares websites in Melbourne and ran some technical checks on onesixeightlondon.com.au.

Found three issues holding back your search visibility:

**Your homepage title is only 20 characters** - just "One Six Eight London" while competitors use the full 60 characters to include products and location like "Designer Wall Clocks, Vases & Mirrors | Melbourne Showroom". You're missing prime SEO real estate.

**16 out of 23 images are missing alt text** - that's 70% of your homepage images. This means you're invisible in Google Images for searches like "designer wall clocks Melbourne" or "modern vases Australia". Plus it's an accessibility issue.

**Your meta description is only 30 characters** - "Affordable designer home décor" when you could use 160 characters to showcase your 5-year warranty, price match guarantee, and London design heritage.

The ironic part? You have amazing competitive advantages (5-year warranty, price match, Melbourne showroom) but they're invisible in search results because they're not in your title or meta.

Quick fixes that typically work:
• Update title to "Designer Wall Clocks, Vases & Mirrors | 5 Year Warranty | One Six Eight London Melbourne"
• Add descriptive alt text to all product images
• Expand meta description to highlight USPs

These changes usually improve visibility within 2-3 weeks and increase click-through rates by 20-30%.

This is just from automated Chrome scans. Happy to run a deeper analysis if you'd like to capture more organic traffic for your showroom.

Worth a quick chat about improving One Six Eight London's visibility?

## Email Version 2: Data-Focused Approach

**Subject:** Your homepage is using 20 of 60 SEO characters

**To:** [Contact Name/info@onesixeightlondon.com.au]

Hi [Name],

Quick question - did you know your homepage title tag is only 20 characters when Google allows 60?

I ran some SEO checks on onesixeightlondon.com.au and found you're leaving 40 characters of prime search real estate empty. Current title: "One Six Eight London" vs what competitors use: "Designer Wall Clocks, Vases, Mirrors | 5 Year Warranty | [Brand] Melbourne"

Two other things stood out:

1. **70% of your images have no alt text** (16 out of 23) - Google can't index them for image search
2. **Your meta description is 30 chars** when you could use 160 to showcase warranty, price match, showroom

The frustrating part? You have incredible USPs (5-year warranty, price match guarantee, Melbourne showroom, London design) that aren't visible in search results.

Most homewares sites in Melbourne are ranking for "designer wall clocks Melbourne" and "homewares Cheltenham" because they're using full title optimization. You should own those searches with your showroom location.

Happy to jump on a 15-minute call to show you exactly which searches you're missing and how to fix it.

## Email Version 3: Benefit-Focused Approach (Recommended)

**Subject:** Missing customers searching "designer wall clocks Melbourne"

**To:** [Contact Name/info@onesixeightlondon.com.au]

Hi [Name],

I was searching "designer wall clocks Melbourne" and noticed One Six Eight London doesn't show up on page 1, despite having a showroom in Cheltenham and beautiful products.

Ran some quick SEO checks to see why - found three fixable issues:

Your homepage title is just "One Six Eight London" (20 characters) when you could use 60 characters to include your products and location. Competitors use titles like "Designer Wall Clocks, Vases & Mirrors | Melbourne | [Brand]"

You're also missing alt text on 70% of homepage images, which means you're invisible in Google Images for searches like "modern vases Melbourne" or "designer wall clocks Australia" despite having stunning products.

Plus your meta description is only 30 characters when you could use 160 to highlight your 5-year warranty and price match guarantee - competitive advantages that should be front and center in search results.

The good news? These are quick fixes (2-3 hours of work) that typically increase organic visibility by 30-50% within a few weeks. No technical rebuild needed, just better optimization of what you already have.

I specialize in helping Melbourne retailers capture more organic traffic. Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call where I can show you exactly which searches you should be owning with your showroom and product range?

## Internal Notes

### Why This Approach Works:

1. **Specific Data Points:** "20 of 60 characters", "16 out of 23 images", "70%" - concrete numbers are credible
2. **Relatable Problem:** They can understand "invisible in search" vs technical jargon
3. **Quick Win Framing:** "2-3 hours of work" makes it seem achievable
4. **USP Reminder:** Highlighting their 5-year warranty/price match shows we understand their business
5. **Local Angle:** Melbourne showroom + location-based searches create urgency

### Personalization Opportunities:

- Reference specific products ("your ELSA wall clocks" or "TINA mirrors")
- Mention their "designed in London" heritage
- Note their excellent customer reviews (4.9/5.0 stars visible on site)
- Reference their Cheltenham showroom location specifically

### Email Sending Best Practices:

- **Send Time:** Tuesday-Thursday, 10am AEST (when they're likely checking email)
- **From:** ali@riflebirdagency.com.au (professional domain)
- **Personalize:** Find actual contact name (not just info@)
- **Track:** Use email tracking to see opens/clicks
- **Follow-up Schedule:** Day 4, Day 7, then move to nurture

### Expected Response Rate:

- **Open Rate:** 40-50% (local business, relevant subject)
- **Reply Rate:** 8-12% (specific data, clear value prop)
- **Positive Reply:** 5-8% (interested in call/more info)

### If They Reply:

→ Trigger Layer 2: Lite Audit (Path B - E-commerce)
→ Use Ahrefs to get:
- Exact organic traffic numbers
- Competitor comparison (Temple & Webster, Adairs, etc.)
- Page 2 keyword opportunities
- Backlink profile analysis

## A/B Testing Notes

**Test Subject Lines:**
- A: "One Six Eight London invisible for 'designer wall clocks Melbourne'" (curiosity)
- B: "Your homepage is using 20 of 60 SEO characters" (data-driven)
- C: "Missing customers searching 'designer wall clocks Melbourne'" (benefit-focused)

**Hypothesis:** Version C (benefit-focused) will perform best because it immediately shows what they're losing (customers) rather than what's wrong (technical issue).

**Track:** Open rate, reply rate, positive reply rate for each version.
