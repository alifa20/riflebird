## Variation A: Local Angle Opening

**Subject**: Your Hawthorn plumbing business doesn't show in Google Maps

```
Hi [Name],

I'm based in Melbourne and was checking which plumbers show up when locals search "plumber Hawthorn" - your business doesn't appear in the top 3 Google Maps results even though you're right there on Burwood Road.

What's odd: You have 127 reviews (4.8 stars) while the #1 ranked plumber has 42 reviews (4.2 stars).

The issue is your Google Business Profile - it's missing key information Google uses for local rankings:

• Service areas not defined (Google doesn't know you serve Hawthorn, Kew, Surrey Hills)
• Business hours show "Unknown" (residents searching at 10pm for emergency plumbing can't tell if you're available)
• Only 3 photos vs competitors with 15-20 photos showing work, team, vehicles

Also found your address listed 3 different ways across directories:
- "142 Burwood Rd, Hawthorn"
- "142 Burwood Road, Hawthorn VIC 3122"
- "142B Burwood Rd, Hawthorn"

→ Google doesn't know which is correct, so it doesn't fully trust your location

You should own "plumber Hawthorn" and "emergency plumber Hawthorn" with your reviews and track record. The fixes take about 90 minutes.

Worth a quick 15-minute call to show you exactly what to update?

P.S. Fellow Hawthorn local here - you fixed my hot water system 2 years ago! Just wanted to give you a heads up about this.
```

**Word Count**: 213 words

**Why This Works for Local Service**:
- Local connection ("I'm based in Melbourne")
- Specific local search term ("plumber Hawthorn")
- Shows unfairness (better reviews, lower ranking)
- Explains Google Maps "local pack" without jargon
- Lists specific missing info Google needs
- Address inconsistency is relatable problem
- Personal P.S. creates trust (real customer)
- Time estimate (90 minutes) shows it's manageable

## Variation B: Emergency Search Scenario

**Subject**: Searched "emergency plumber Hawthorn 2am" - you didn't show up

```
Hi [Name],

Genuine question: When someone's hot water system bursts at 2am in Hawthorn and they Google "emergency plumber Hawthorn", does your 24/7 service appear?

Checked this morning and you're not in the top 3 Google Maps results. The plumbers who DO show up:
- #1: 42 reviews (4.2 stars) - doesn't mention 24/7
- #2: 18 reviews (3.9 stars) - shows "Closed" after hours
- #3: 31 reviews (4.5 stars) - from Richmond (3km away)

You: 127 reviews (4.8 stars), 24/7 emergency service, actually IN Hawthorn - but #7 on the list.

The reason: Your Google Business Profile doesn't communicate what you told me:

Your current info:
• Hours: "Unknown" (people can't tell you're 24/7)
• Service areas: Not defined (Google doesn't know you cover emergencies in Hawthorn, Kew, Camberwell)
• Business category: Just "Plumber" (should also include "Emergency plumber" and "Hot water system installer")

Quick fixes (takes about 90 minutes):
1. Set hours to 24/7 and enable "Open now" badge
2. Add service areas with radius
3. Add all relevant categories
4. Upload 10-15 photos (van, team, completed work)
5. Fix address inconsistencies across directories

Worth a call to walk through it? Emergency plumbing searches spike at night - you should be capturing those.

P.S. Your "Family-owned since 1998" and master plumber license aren't visible in Google - competitors without these credentials rank higher!
```

**Word Count**: 234 words

**Why This Works for Emergency Services**:
- Opens with realistic emergency scenario
- Time-specific search (2am) creates urgency
- Shows competitor analysis with review comparison
- Highlights unfairness (best reviews, worst ranking)
- Lists specific missing info hurting visibility
- "Unknown" hours is specific, fixable problem
- Emphasizes opportunity cost (emergency searches at night)
- P.S. highlights credentials being wasted

---

## Variation C: "Near Me" Search Focus

**Subject**: "Plumber near me" shows competitors 5km away before you

```
Hi [Name],

Stood outside 142 Burwood Road yesterday and searched "plumber near me" on my phone.

Results were wild:
- #1: Richmond plumber (4.7km away)
- #2: Kew plumber (2.3km away)
- #3: Camberwell plumber (3.1km away)
- #7: Hawthorn Plumbing (literally standing outside your door)

With 127 reviews and 4.8 stars, you should dominate "near me" searches in Hawthorn. Here's what's holding you back:

Google doesn't know where you service:
• Address format inconsistent (142 vs 142B Burwood Rd)
• No service radius defined in your profile
• Missing "Hawthorn" in business description
• Location pages missing for Kew, Surrey Hills, Camberwell

Also checked your website:
• Contact page doesn't mention suburbs you serve
• No local area keywords ("Hawthorn plumber", "Kew plumbing")
• Missing "serving Hawthorn since 1998" story

67% of local service searches are "near me" or "[service] [suburb]" - you're invisible for both.

The competitor 4.7km away in Richmond is getting Hawthorn residents' calls while you're right there.

Let's hop on a 15-minute call - I'll show you the exact Google Business Profile updates and website changes. Takes about 2 hours total.

P.S. You've been serving Hawthorn for 25+ years - that local expertise should be your biggest SEO advantage, not invisible!
```

**Word Count**: 227 words

**Why This Works for Local Service**:
- Starts with physical location test (very tangible)
- "Near me" search is relatable and common
- Shows absurd situation (standing outside, still not #1)
- Lists specific competitors by distance
- Explains what Google "doesn't know"
- Mentions local area pages (common gap)
- 67% stat makes "near me" searches important
- Emphasizes lost calls to farther competitors
- P.S. leverages their longevity

## Key Differences from E-Commerce Emails

| Element | E-Commerce | Local Service |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| **Main Focus** | Product visibility, image search | Google Maps, "near me" searches |
| **Primary Tool** | Title tags, product schema | Google Business Profile |
| **Urgency Driver** | Competitor rankings, paid ads | Emergency calls, proximity paradox |
| **Proof Point** | Traffic numbers, ROI | Reviews, years in business, local presence |
| **Common Issue** | Missing alt text, thin meta | NAP inconsistency, incomplete GBP |
| **Search Examples** | "[product] [location]" | "[service] near me", "emergency [service]" |
| **Decision Maker** | Owner, marketing manager | Owner-operator |
| **Tone** | Can be data-driven | More personal, community-focused |

## Local Service Industry Adaptations

### Restaurants/Cafes:
```
Subject: Searched "brunch Richmond" - your 4.9-star cafe is #12

"Cafes with worse food, fewer reviews, farther away rank higher on Google Maps.
The issue: Your menu isn't uploaded to Google, cuisine type is generic 'Restaurant'
instead of specific 'Brunch spot', and your hours show 'Might be open' instead of
actual times."

P.S. Your smashed avo is legendary - shame most locals find you through word-of-mouth instead of Google.
```

### Dental/Medical:
```
Subject: "Dentist Hawthorn bulk billing" - you offer it but don't show up

"Families searching for bulk billing dentists in Hawthorn see 6 clinics before yours.
The issue: 'Bulk billing' isn't in your Google Business description, your profile
doesn't list accepted health funds, and Google doesn't know you're gentle with kids
(huge search term)."

P.S. Your 20+ years treating Hawthorn families should be your #1 SEO asset - currently buried on your About page.
```

### Gyms/Fitness:
```
Subject: "Gym near me" shows Anytime Fitness before your local gym

"Checked from your Burwood Road location - chain gyms 2km away rank higher than you.
The issue: Your Google photos show equipment but not your community vibe, 'trial' and
'membership prices' aren't in your description, and you're categorized as generic 'Gym'
instead of 'Personal training' and 'Group fitness classes'."

P.S. Your tight-knit community and local ownership are selling points - invisible in Google searches.
```

### Real Estate:
```
Subject: "Real estate agent Toorak" - you're #9 with 84 sales this year

"Agents with 12 sales/year rank higher than you for 'real estate agent Toorak'.
The issue: Your sold properties aren't showcased in Google Business photos,
'recent sales' and 'local expert' aren't in your description, and suburb specialization
(Toorak, South Yarra, Prahran) isn't defined."

P.S. 84 sales in 12 months is impressive - sellers searching Google don't see that achievement.
```

## Common Local Service Objections

### "I get enough work from referrals":
**Address in email**:
```
"Referrals are gold, but 'emergency [service] near me' searches at 2am aren't calling their friends for recommendations - they click the top 3 Google results. You're leaving those calls on the table."
```

### "Already on Google":
**Address in follow-up**:
```
"You ARE on Google, but #7 in local pack vs #1-3 means you get 5% of clicks instead of 65%. Position matters more than just being listed."
```

### "Too busy already":
**Address in P.S.**:
```
P.S. If you're at capacity, this might not be worth it. But if you ever want to grow or hire another team, being #1 in local search makes scaling much easier.
```

### "Don't have time for marketing":
**Address in CTA**:
```
"All updates are in your Google Business dashboard - I'll give you a checklist, takes 90 minutes one time. No ongoing work."
```

## Follow-Up Email for Local Service (If No Response)

**Subject**: Quick Google Business Profile checklist for Hawthorn Plumbing

```
Hi [Name],

Sent you a note last week about Hawthorn Plumbing's Google Maps ranking.

Figured I'd share the Google Business Profile quick fixes regardless - takes about 90 minutes:

**Google Business Profile Updates** (in your dashboard):
1. Set hours to "Open 24 hours" + enable "Open now" badge
2. Add service areas: Hawthorn, Kew, Surrey Hills, Camberwell (10km radius)
3. Add categories: "Plumber", "Emergency plumber", "Hot water installer", "Gas fitter"
4. Upload 10-15 photos: van with logo, team, completed work, before/afters
5. Write description: "Family-owned Hawthorn plumber since 1998. 24/7 emergency service. Licensed master plumber. Same-day hot water repairs. Serving Hawthorn, Kew, Surrey Hills."

**Address Consistency**:
Fix these directories to all say "142 Burwood Road, Hawthorn VIC 3122":
- True Local
- Yellow Pages
- Localsearch
- Your website footer

Within 2-4 weeks, you'll start appearing higher in "plumber near me" and "emergency plumber Hawthorn" searches.

If you want the full breakdown including website fixes, just reply "send it".

Best,

P.S. Google prioritizes complete profiles - yours is 60% complete vs top-ranked competitors at 95%+. Worth closing that gap.
```

**Why This Works**:
- Specific instructions (not vague advice)
- Organized by platform (GBP vs directories)
- Exact description to copy-paste
- Realistic timeline (2-4 weeks)
- Low-friction CTA
- Builds trust through free help
