# B2B/SaaS Cold Email Example
## Hypothetical: ProjectFlow (Australian Project Management Software)

This example shows how to adapt the framework for B2B and SaaS companies.

---

## Hypothetical Audit Summary

**Company**: ProjectFlow
**Domain**: projectflow.com.au
**Industry**: B2B SaaS (Project Management Software)
**Target Market**: Australian SMBs (50-200 employees)
**Product**: Cloud project management platform

**Top 3 Issues Found**:
1. No comparison pages ("ProjectFlow vs [Competitor]") - buyers search for these
2. Blog content doesn't target buyer intent keywords ("best project management for [industry]")
3. Not ranking for high-value keywords ("project management software australia", "asana alternative australia")

**Positive Findings**:
- Australian data hosting (compliance advantage)
- Strong integration with Xero (unique to AU market)
- 24/7 Australian support team
- Competitive pricing vs international tools
- Great product

**Competitive Landscape**:
- Competing with Asana, Monday.com, Trello (international)
- ClickUp, Notion (growing)
- Local advantage with data sovereignty, but invisible in search

---

## Variation A: Buyer Intent Keywords

**Subject**: Your buyers are searching "ProjectFlow vs Asana" - that page doesn't exist

```
Hi [Name],

Quick research: When Australian businesses evaluate project management tools, 73% search for comparison content like "ProjectFlow vs Asana" or "Monday.com vs ProjectFlow alternative".

Checked your site - none of these pages exist.

This means when a prospect is:
• Already aware of ProjectFlow (high-intent buyer)
• Actively comparing you to Asana/Monday/Trello
• Ready to make a decision

→ They land on third-party review sites instead of your website. You have zero control over the narrative.

Current situation:
- "ProjectFlow vs Asana" - no page, Software Advice owns page 1
- "ProjectFlow vs Monday" - no page, G2 comparison ranks #1
- "Asana alternative Australia" - you don't rank (should be #1 with AU data hosting)

Also checked your blog:
• No posts targeting "best project management for [construction/marketing/agencies]"
• Nothing about Australian data sovereignty compliance (massive buying factor for gov/healthcare)
• Missing "how to choose" buyer-intent content

You have huge competitive advantages (AU data hosting, Xero integration, local support) but prospects comparing tools never see them.

Quick call to walk through a comparison page strategy? These pages typically convert at 12-18% vs 2-3% for homepage.

P.S. monday.com has 47 comparison pages ("Monday vs X"). They're capturing your prospects at the decision stage.
```

**Word Count**: 221 words

**Why This Works for B2B/SaaS**:
- Leads with buyer behavior stat (73%)
- Shows high-intent search terms
- Explains lost opportunity (third-party sites control narrative)
- Lists specific missing comparison pages
- Highlights unique selling points (AU data, Xero, support)
- Conversion rate comparison (12-18% vs 2-3%)
- Competitive intelligence in P.S.

## Variation B: Competitor Visibility Gap

**Subject**: Asana ranks for 847 keywords you don't (but should)

```
Hi [Name],

Ran a competitive analysis on ProjectFlow vs Asana, Monday.com, and ClickUp for Australian search terms.

The gap is significant:

**Keyword Rankings** (Australian searches):
- Asana: 847 keywords related to project management
- Monday.com: 623 keywords
- ClickUp: 412 keywords
- ProjectFlow: 67 keywords

What's interesting: You have better features for Australian businesses (local data hosting, Xero integration, AU timezone support) but international competitors dominate search.

**Missing opportunities**:
1. Industry-specific searches: "project management for construction australia", "agency project management software"
2. Comparison searches: "Asana alternative", "Monday.com vs [alternatives]"
3. Compliance searches: "project management software Australian data", "GDPR compliant project management"
4. Integration searches: "project management with Xero integration"

Your website has:
• 12 blog posts (Asana has 340+)
• No comparison pages (Monday has 47)
• No industry-specific landing pages (ClickUp has 15+)

The frustrating part? You have LOCAL advantages:
- Australian data centers (government/healthcare compliance)
- Same timezone support (huge for agencies)
- Xero integration (40% of AU SMBs use Xero)

But prospects searching Google find Asana/Monday first because they've built content around every buyer question.

Worth a call to discuss content strategy? I can show you the exact keyword gaps and page types missing.

P.S. "Project management software Australia" gets 1,200 searches/month - Asana ranks #1, you're #14. With your local advantages, you should own that keyword.
```

**Word Count**: 241 words

**Why This Works for SaaS**:
- Starts with competitive data (847 vs 67 keywords)
- Shows specific competitor numbers
- Lists missing content types (comparisons, industry pages)
- Highlights local competitive advantages
- Addresses Australian data sovereignty (real buying factor)
- Content gap analysis (12 posts vs 340+)
- Specific keyword search volume in P.S.

## Variation C: Cost Per Acquisition Focus

**Subject**: You're paying $180/click for "project management software" - here's why

```
Hi [Name],

Noticed ProjectFlow is running Google Ads for "project management software australia" at ~$180 CPC (checked SpyFu).

Meanwhile, you're ranking #14 organically for the same keyword. Position #1 gets 42% of clicks, position #14 gets less than 1%.

Quick math:
- Organic clicks at #1: ~500/month (free)
- Your current organic clicks at #14: ~12/month (free)
- Paid clicks to compensate: ~40/month at $180 = $7,200/month

Annual paid ad spend to compensate for poor organic: ~$86,000

Here's what's keeping you at #14:
1. No comprehensive buying guides ("How to choose project management software for Australian businesses")
2. Missing industry-specific content (construction, agencies, professional services)
3. No comparison pages capturing high-intent searches
4. Blog posts don't target buyer keywords

Asana (#1 organically) isn't a better product for Australian businesses - they just have 340 blog posts answering every buyer question vs your 12 posts.

We helped an Australian HR SaaS company go from #12 to #3 for their main keyword in 6 months - they cut Google Ads by 60% while total leads increased 35%. I have the case study data if you want to see it.

What's interesting: Your Australian data hosting and Xero integration are HUGE advantages for your market, but invisible to prospects searching for solutions.

Worth a call to walk through the content gaps and expected ROI?

Best,
Ali Fathieh
Digital Marketing Specialist

Melbourne

P.S. Every month you stay at #14 costs you ~$7,200 in ads. Organic content is one-time work with permanent returns.
```

**Word Count**: 259 words

**Why This Works for SaaS**:
- Starts with specific CPC ($180 - real for competitive SaaS keywords)
- Shows math: position #1 vs #14 impact
- Annual cost projection ($86k) creates urgency
- Explains WHY they're at #14 (content gap)
- References case study (HR SaaS) in similar space
- ROI angle (cut ads 60%, increase leads 35%)
- P.S. reinforces monthly cost

## B2B/SaaS Content Gap Analysis Framework

### Missing Page Types (Include in Email):

**1. Comparison Pages**:
```
"[YourProduct] vs [Competitor]"
"[YourProduct] vs [Competitor]": Feature comparison, pricing, Australian advantages
"[Competitor] alternative Australia"
"Best [Competitor] alternatives for [industry]"
```

**2. Industry-Specific Landing Pages**:
```
"Project management for construction companies"
"Agency project management software"
"Project management for professional services"
"Marketing team project management"
```

**3. Buyer Intent Content**:
```
"How to choose project management software for Australian businesses"
"Project management software comparison guide 2025"
"Switching from [Competitor]: Migration guide"
```

**4. Compliance/Regional Content**:
```
"Australian data hosting project management"
"GDPR compliant project management software"
"Project management with Xero integration"
```

**5. Use Case Pages**:
```
"Remote team project management Australia"
"Project management for agencies with 20-50 employees"
"Client work management for consultancies"
```

## B2B/SaaS Industry Adaptations

### HR Software:
```
Subject: "BambooHR alternative Australia" gets 320 searches/month - you don't rank

"Australian businesses searching for HR software want local payroll integration (Xero, MYOB)
and Fair Work compliance - your biggest advantages. But 'HR software Australia' search
results show BambooHR, Gusto, and Zenefits (all US-based) before you.

Missing: Comparison pages, 'Australian payroll software' content, Fair Work compliance guides."

P.S. Data sovereignty is a legal requirement for some industries - should be your #1 SEO angle.
```

### CRM Software:
```
Subject: Your CRM has Xero integration - buyers searching for it don't find you

"'CRM with Xero integration' gets 880 searches/month from Australian businesses.
You have the integration. HubSpot and Salesforce don't. But you're #11 and they're #1-2.

Missing: Integration-focused landing pages, case studies showing Xero sync, comparison pages."

P.S. 38% of Australian SMBs use Xero - that's your niche, but it's invisible in search.
```

### Marketing Automation:
```
Subject: "HubSpot vs [alternatives]" searches - 12 competitors have pages, you don't

"When Australian marketers evaluate HubSpot, they search for alternatives. 12 competitors
have '[Product] vs HubSpot' pages. You don't.

Missing: Comparison pages, 'Australian marketing automation' content, 'HubSpot alternative for SMBs'."

P.S. HubSpot is $1,200+/month. Your $299/month is compelling - if prospects could find the comparison.
```

### Accounting Software:
```
Subject: You rank #1 for brand searches, #27 for "accounting software Australia"

"People who know you find you. People who don't know you find Xero, MYOB, QuickBooks.

Missing: Educational content ('choosing accounting software guide'), industry-specific pages
('accounting for tradies', 'construction accounting'), integration content."

P.S. "MYOB alternative" gets 420 searches/month - you're a perfect fit but don't appear in results.
```

## Common B2B/SaaS Objections & Responses

### "We're focused on paid ads for now":
**Address in email**:
```
"Paid ads are great for testing, but CAC of $180/lead compounds every month. Organic content
is one-time work that reduces CAC permanently. Best SaaS companies do both - paid for speed,
organic for sustainable growth."
```

### "Our product sells itself through referrals":
**Address**:
```
"Referrals are gold, but 67% of B2B buyers research independently before talking to sales.
When they Google '[your category]', you're invisible - they're finding competitors first.
Referrals work better when prospects have already discovered you online."
```

### "We have a content marketer":
**Address in P.S.**:
```
P.S. Not stepping on toes - happy to share the keyword gap analysis with your content team.
Most in-house marketers love having this data.
```

### "Too busy building product":
**Address in CTA**:
```
"Totally get it - product comes first. This would be a one-time content strategy session
(30 mins) then your team executes at their pace. No ongoing meetings needed."
```

## Follow-Up Email for B2B/SaaS (If No Response)

**Subject**: Quick comparison page template for ProjectFlow

```
Hi [Name],

Sent you a note last week about ProjectFlow's search visibility for comparison terms.

Figured I'd share a comparison page template anyway - might be useful for your team:

**"ProjectFlow vs Asana" Page Structure**:

**Title**: "ProjectFlow vs Asana: Australia's Project Management Comparison [2025]"

**Sections**:
1. Quick Comparison Table (features, pricing, support, data location)
2. Key Differences for Australian Businesses
   - Data hosting (AU vs US)
   - Support timezone (AEST vs PST)
   - Integrations (Xero vs QuickBooks)
   - Compliance (Australian vs international)
3. When to Choose ProjectFlow
   - Need Australian data hosting
   - Want same-timezone support
   - Use Xero for accounting
   - Value pricing ($X vs Asana's $X)
4. When to Choose Asana
   - Large enterprise (500+ users)
   - Already invested in Google Workspace ecosystem
   - International teams across multiple regions

**Key SEO Elements**:
- Target keyword: "projectflow vs asana australia"
- Secondary keywords: "asana alternative australia", "project management australian data"
- Include screenshots of both products
- Add comparison table (HTML, not image - Google can read it)
- Link to free trial at end

Create 8-10 of these (vs Asana, Monday, ClickUp, Trello, Notion, Jira, Basecamp, Wrike)
and you'll start capturing high-intent comparison searches within 4-6 weeks.

If you want the full keyword gap analysis and content roadmap, just reply "send it".

P.S. Your "Australian data hosting" is a massive compliance advantage - comparison pages are
where you highlight that vs international competitors.

**Why This Works**:
- Provides immediately useful template
- Specific structure they can copy
- SEO elements explained clearly
- Lists which pages to create (8-10 competitors)
- Timeline for results (4-6 weeks)
- Low-friction CTA
