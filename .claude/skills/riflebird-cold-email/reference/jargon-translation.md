## Translation Formula

When you encounter SEO jargon, translate using this formula:

**Pattern**: [What it means] → [What it costs them] → [What they should do]

**Example**:
- ❌ "Your canonical tags are misconfigured"
- ✅ "You have duplicate pages → Google ranks the wrong version → Visitors land on old product pages and leave"

**Example**:
- ❌ "Your robots.txt is blocking Googlebot"
- ✅ "Your settings block Google → Half your pages aren't in search results → Potential customers can't find those products"

**Example**:
- ❌ "Your page has poor topical relevance"
- ✅ "Your page talks about [X] → People searching for [Y] land there and leave → Google stops showing your page because it's not relevant"

## Final Rule

**If you can't explain it in business terms, don't include it in the email.**

The goal is to make prospects think:
- "I understand this problem"
- "This costs me money/customers"
- "This sounds fixable"

NOT:
- "What does that term mean?"
- "This sounds complicated"
- "I need to hire an expert to understand this"
