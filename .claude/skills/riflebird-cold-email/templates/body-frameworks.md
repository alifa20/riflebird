# Body Frameworks for Issue Presentation

How to structure the main body of cold emails to present SEO issues in business language.

---

## Framework 1: The Billboard Metaphor

**When to Use**: Title tag issues, meta description problems, character limits

**Structure**:
```
[Main Issue Statement - Use metaphor]

Current: [Their current state - show the problem]

vs [Ideal state or competitor example]

→ [Business impact in one line]
```

**Example**:

```
Your homepage title is using 20 of 60 available characters in Google search results.

That's like paying for a billboard and only using 1/3 of it.

Current: "One Six Eight London" (20 chars)

vs competitors: "Designer Wall Clocks, Vases & Mirrors | 5 Year Warranty | Temple & Webster Melbourne" (60 chars)

→ You're leaving prime search real estate empty while competitors fill it with products, benefits, and location
```

**Why It Works**:
- Visual metaphor everyone understands
- Shows the gap clearly
- Competitor comparison creates urgency
- Ends with business impact

---

## Framework 2: The Invisible Inventory

**When to Use**: Image alt text issues, product schema missing, image search problems

**Structure**:
```
[Shocking percentage] of your [products/images/pages] are invisible in [specific search type]

[Specific numbers showing the gap]

This means when [target customer] searches for:
• [Keyword example 1]
• [Keyword example 2]
• [Keyword example 3]

→ [Competitor/situation] shows up, yours don't
```

**Example**:

```
70% of your product images are invisible in Google Images.

16 out of 23 images on your homepage have no descriptions, which means Google can't index them.

This means when Melbourne shoppers search for:
• "designer wall clocks"
• "modern vases australia"
• "luxury mirrors melbourne"

→ Your competitors' products show up in image results, yours don't - missing hundreds of monthly visitors
```

**Why It Works**:
- Percentage creates immediate impact
- Specific numbers build credibility
- Real search examples make it tangible
- Shows opportunity cost

---

## Framework 3: The Hidden Gold

**When to Use**: Strong USPs not leveraged, great features invisible in search

**Structure**:
```
You have [amazing feature/USP] but it's invisible when [target customer] searches [keyword]

[Current situation - what they see]

Could be: [Better version highlighting USPs]

→ Impact: [What they're missing]
```

**Example**:

```
You have a 5-year warranty and price match guarantee, but neither appears in your search results.

Current: "Affordable designer home décor" (30 characters)

Could be: "Designer homewares from London: wall clocks, vases, mirrors. 5-year warranty, price match guarantee. Melbourne showroom. Free AU shipping $99+" (158 chars)

→ Impact: Shoppers seeing your listing don't know about your competitive advantages - lower click rates even when you DO rank
```

**Why It Works**:
- Positions them as winners
- Shows they're close to success
- Before/after comparison clear
- Removes "you're doing it wrong" sting

---

## Framework 4: The Competitor Gap

**When to Use**: When audit shows clear competitive disadvantage, ranking behind weaker competitors

**Structure**:
```
[Competitor] ranks #[position] for "[keyword]" while you're #[position]

The difference: [One specific thing they do better]

[Show the comparison with numbers/examples]

→ [Market position impact]
```

**Example**:

```
Temple & Webster ranks #1 for "designer homewares Melbourne" while One Six Eight London is #24 (page 3).

The difference: Their homepage title uses all 60 characters to include products, benefits, and location.

Temple & Webster: "Designer Homewares, Furniture & Décor | 100 Day Returns | Free Delivery Over $65 | Melbourne"

You: "One Six Eight London" (20 chars)

→ They capture 10x more search traffic for your shared keywords - just from better title optimization
```

**Why It Works**:
- Competitive context creates urgency
- Specific ranking positions prove it
- Shows the gap is fixable
- Quantifies opportunity

---

## Framework 5: The Local Disconnect

**When to Use**: Local businesses not showing up in local searches, Google Business Profile issues

**Structure**:
```
Your [location] business doesn't show up when [local customers] search "[local keyword]"

[Verification method - when/how you checked]

[Specific local search examples]:
• [Search term 1] - not in top 3 local pack
• [Search term 2] - competitors from [further area] rank higher
• [Search term 3] - you're on page [X]

→ [Local opportunity cost]
```

**Example**:

```
Your Cheltenham showroom doesn't appear when locals search "homewares Cheltenham" or "furniture showroom Melbourne"

Checked this morning from 78 Herald St (your address):
• "homewares Cheltenham" - not in Google Maps top 3
• "furniture showroom Melbourne" - competitors from Richmond and Prahran rank higher
• "designer homewares near me" - you're #7, below stores 15km away

→ Neighbors walking past your showroom don't find you in Google - they're seeing competitors from other suburbs instead
```

**Why It Works**:
- Hyper-local relevance
- Absurd disconnect (you're there but invisible)
- Creates urgency for local business
- Specific verification builds trust

---

## Framework 6: The Mobile Problem

**When to Use**: Mobile usability issues, mobile search visibility problems

**Structure**:
```
[Percentage]% of your [customers/industry] search on mobile, but [specific mobile issue]

[How you discovered it - verification]

On mobile:
• [Issue 1]
• [Issue 2]
• [Issue 3]

→ [Impact on mobile users and Google ranking]
```

**Example**:

```
82% of homewares shoppers research on their phones, but your site has 3 critical mobile issues Google is tracking.

Checked on iPhone and Chrome DevTools:
• Product images don't load properly on 3G/4G
• Menu navigation breaks on screens under 400px width
• Contact form doesn't work on mobile Safari

→ Google ranks mobile-friendly sites higher in ALL searches now (not just mobile) - this is hurting your desktop rankings too
```

**Why It Works**:
- Industry-specific percentage
- Multiple specific issues
- Verification method shown
- Desktop impact creates broader urgency

---

## Framework 7: The Search Intent Mismatch

**When to Use**: Wrong content for search intent, missing key pages, content gaps

**Structure**:
```
When people search "[keyword]", they want [specific thing] but your page shows [different thing]

[Evidence of intent - what competitors/top results show]

Your [page]:
[What's missing or wrong]

Top-ranking competitors include:
• [Element 1 they all have]
• [Element 2 they all have]
• [Element 3 they all have]

→ [Ranking/traffic impact]
```

**Example**:

```
When people search "wall clock installation Melbourne", they want pricing and service info, but your page only shows products for sale.

Checked top 10 results - 8 of them are installation services, not product retailers.

Your product page ranks #12 for this search because:
• No installation service information
• No pricing guide
• No local service area coverage

Top-ranking pages all include: pricing tables, service area maps, and "book installation" CTAs.

→ You're ranking for the wrong intent - this keyword gets 480 searches/month but sends you zero qualified traffic
```

**Why It Works**:
- Shows deep understanding of search
- Evidence-based (checked top results)
- Clear gap identification
- Wasted opportunity angle

---

## Framework 8: The Quick Win Stack

**When to Use**: Multiple small issues that compound, when you want to show easy fixes

**Structure**:
```
Found [number] quick fixes that would take [time estimate] to implement:

1. [Issue + one-line impact]
2. [Issue + one-line impact]
3. [Issue + one-line impact]

Each one is simple, but together:
→ [Cumulative impact]
```

**Example**:

```
Found 3 quick fixes that would take about 2 hours total:

1. Extend your homepage title from 20 to 60 characters - rank for 4 more product keywords
2. Add descriptions to 16 product images - appear in Google Images for "designer [product]" searches
3. Update meta description to include your 5-year warranty and price match - increase click rates by 25-40%

Each fix is simple Shopify admin work, but together:
→ Estimated 300-500 additional monthly visitors from Google within 4-6 weeks
```

**Why It Works**:
- Shows multiple opportunities
- Time estimate removes "too hard" objection
- Numbered list is scannable
- Cumulative impact is compelling
- Includes timeline for results

## Framework 9: The "You're So Close" Angle

**When to Use**: When they have good content/products but small technical issues holding them back

**Structure**:
```
Your [positive attribute] is better than [competitors], but [small technical issue] is holding you back

[Evidence of their strength]

The only gap:
[One specific fixable thing]

→ Fix this and [positive outcome]
```

**Example**:

```
Your product photography is better than Temple & Webster and Adairs, but Google can't see it.

Your images:
• Professional styling
• Multiple angles
• Lifestyle context
• Better than 90% of competitors

The only gap: None of them have alt text descriptions, so Google treats them as decorative images instead of products.

→ Add descriptions like "Black silent wall clock 40cm ELSA design" and you'll start ranking in Google Images within days - your quality will win over competitors' mediocre photos
```

**Why It Works**:
- Starts with genuine compliment
- Acknowledges their strengths
- Makes problem feel small
- Creates confidence they can win

---

## Framework 10: The Cost Comparison (Paid Ads Angle)

**When to Use**: When prospect is running paid ads, wants to introduce the case study, tight budget situation

**Structure**:
```
Noticed you're running [ad type] for "[keyword]" - checked the numbers and found [comparison]

Current situation:
• [Ad spend observation or estimate]
• [Organic ranking position]
• [What they're paying for vs what they could own]

[Brief case study reference if using screenshot]

→ [Cost/sustainability impact]
```

**Example**:

```
Noticed you're running Google Shopping ads for "designer wall clocks" - you're paying $2.40 per click while ranking #24 organically for the same keyword.

Current situation:
• Google Ads bringing 200 clicks/month at ~$480/month
• Organic ranking #24 (page 3) bringing ~15 clicks/month
• You're paying for traffic you should be getting free

We helped a similar homewares store go from #18 to #3 for their main keywords - they cut ad spend from $2,100/month to $600/month while total traffic increased 40%. I have the Ahrefs chart showing the before/after if you want to see it.

→ SEO fixes are one-time work with permanent results vs renting traffic every month through ads
```

**Why It Works**:
- Shows you understand their marketing
- Specific cost breakdown
- Introduces case study naturally
- Framed as sustainability vs efficiency, not "ads are bad"
- Offers visual proof

## Combining Frameworks

For emails with 3 issues, combine frameworks:

**Example Structure**:
1. **Main Issue** (2-3 sentences): Use Framework 1, 2, or 4
2. **Supporting Issues** (2-4 bullets): Use Framework 8 style
3. **Impact** (1-2 sentences): Use Framework 3 or 10

**Sample**:

```
Your homepage title is using 20 of 60 available characters - that's like paying for a billboard and using 1/3 of it. [Framework 1]

Also found:
• 70% of your product images don't appear in Google image searches [Framework 2 style]
• Your 5-year warranty isn't mentioned in search results [Framework 3 style]

You're spending ~$480/month on Google Ads while ranking #24 organically for the same keywords - fix these issues and you could cut that ad spend in half. [Framework 10]
```

---

## Universal Elements to Include

Regardless of framework, always include:

1. **Specific Numbers**: "20 of 60 chars" not "too short"
2. **Competitor Names**: "Temple & Webster" not "competitors"
3. **Search Terms**: Actual keywords in quotes
4. **Location References**: City, suburb names
5. **Time Estimates**: "2-3 hours" not "quick"
6. **Business Impact**: Traffic, revenue, clicks - never just "better SEO"
7. **Verification**: How you found it ("checked today", "ran Chrome DevTools")

---

## What to Avoid

❌ **Vague claims**: "Your SEO needs work"
✅ **Specific findings**: "Your title uses 20 of 60 characters"

❌ **Jargon**: "Your alt tags are missing"
✅ **Business language**: "70% of your products don't appear in image search"

❌ **You're doing it wrong**: "Your site has major issues"
✅ **Opportunity framing**: "Found 3 quick wins worth 300 monthly visitors"

❌ **Generic**: "Many businesses have this problem"
✅ **Specific**: "Temple & Webster ranks #1 while you're #24 - here's why"

❌ **Too technical**: "Your schema implementation lacks Product markup"
✅ **Impact-focused**: "Your products don't show pricing/availability in search results"
