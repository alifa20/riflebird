## Category 1: Objection Handling

### P.S. 1: Not Selling a Retainer

P.S. Not trying to sell you a big SEO retainer - these are simple fixes you could implement in-house in an afternoon. Happy to just share what I found.
```

```
P.S. To be clear, I'm not pitching ongoing services here. These are straightforward Shopify admin changes. Just thought you'd want to know.
```

```

### P.S. 2: No Commitment Required

---

## Category 2: Bonus Value / Free Insights

### P.S. 4: One More Finding

**When to Use**: When you found something extra, sweetening the deal

```
P.S. Also noticed your product schema is missing - this means your prices/availability don't show in Google search results. Easy fix.
```

```
P.S. One more thing: your Google Business Profile says you're "Permanently closed" - probably want to fix that ASAP!
```

```
P.S. Quick bonus: your site loads in 6.3 seconds on mobile (Google benchmark is under 2.5s). I can share the slow elements if useful.
```

---

### P.S. 5: Competitive Intelligence

**Examples**:
```
P.S. Temple & Webster just updated their product schema last week - they're now showing star ratings in search results. Worth matching.

**Examples**:
```
P.S. Your ELSA wall clocks are gorgeous - criminal that they don't show up when people search "luxury wall clocks Melbourne"!
```

```
P.S. The product photography on your site is better than Temple & Webster - shame Google can't "see" it because of missing alt text.
```

```

```

---

## Combining P.S. Strategies

For maximum impact, combine two approaches:

**Personal Touch + Objection Handling**:
```
P.S. Your ELSA clocks are stunning - would love to see them ranking in Google Images. Not pushing for ongoing services, just happy to share the exact alt text format to use.
```

**Value Add + Case Study**:
```
P.S. Found one more quick win: your Google Business Profile hours are incorrect. Also have that Ahrefs chart showing paid vs organic growth if you want to see it.
```

**Local + Urgency**:
```
P.S. Fellow Cheltenham local here - noticed two new homewares stores opened on Charman Road this month. Worth securing your SEO position before they do.
