✅ Offer choice when appropriate
✅ Use their timezone if known

### DON'T:
❌ Apologize ("sorry to bother you")

❌ Use pressure tactics ("limited spots available")
❌ Make it about you ("I'd love to chat")
❌ Overcomplicate ("fill out this form, then we'll...")
❌ Use multiple CTAs in one email

## Testing CTAs

Track which CTAs get the best response:

**High Response CTAs** (typically):
- CTA 2 (Free value offer)
- CTA 3 (Want to see this?)
- CTA 7 (Two options)
- CTA 14 (P.S. CTA)

**Lower Response but Higher Quality**:
- CTA 8 (Calendar link)
- CTA 9 (Direct ask)

**Use Case Study CTA Integration**:

If you're including the paid vs organic screenshot case study, modify CTAs:

```
Want to see the Ahrefs chart showing the paid traffic (green spikes) vs organic growth (orange line)? It tells the story better than I can explain.
```

```
Let's hop on a quick call - I'll share the screenshot showing how we helped a similar business cut ad spend while growing traffic.
```

```
Curious to see what sustainable organic growth looks like vs temporary paid traffic? I have a great visual example from a recent client.
```
