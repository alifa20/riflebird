## Hook 1: The Customer Search Story

**Pattern**: "I was searching for [their product/service] in [location] and [observation]..."

**Best For**: E-commerce, local businesses, consumer services

**Examples**:

```
I was shopping for designer wall clocks in Melbourne last week and searched "designer wall clocks melbourne" - One Six Eight London didn't show up on page 1 despite having a Cheltenham showroom.
```

```
Needed a plumber in Hawthorn yesterday and Googled "emergency plumber hawthorn" - noticed your business wasn't in the top 3 local results even though you're based there.
```

```
Searching for CRM software and typed "best CRM for small business Australia" - your product didn't appear until page 3, but I saw great reviews when I found you.
```

**Why It Works**:
- Human and relatable
- Shows real search behavior
- Creates empathy (you're a potential customer)
- Pattern interrupt (not a typical sales pitch)

---

## Hook 2: The Competitor Comparison

**Pattern**: "[Competitor] ranks #1 for [keyword] and here's the difference..."

**Best For**: Competitive markets, ambitious prospects, B2B

**Examples**:

```
Temple & Webster ranks #1 for "designer homewares Melbourne" with a title tag that's 3x longer than yours - checked and found the gap.
```

```
Your competitor down the street shows up in the Google Maps pack for "cafe Richmond" but you don't - spotted it takes one 5-minute fix.
```

```
HubSpot owns page 1 for "marketing automation Australia" while you're on page 4 - found out why in 10 minutes.
```

**Why It Works**:
- Creates competitive urgency
- Specific and provable
- Shows you've done research
- Makes it about market position, not just technical SEO

---

## Hook 3: The Shocking Stat

**Pattern**: "Quick question - did you know [surprising finding about their site]?"

**Best For**: Prospects who may not know they have a problem, technical buyers

**Examples**:

```
Quick question - did you know your homepage is using only 20 of 60 available characters in Google search results?
```

```
Your website has 847 internal links, but 73 of them point to pages that don't exist anymore. Found it in a quick scan.
```

```
Noticed something odd: your contact page gets 2,400 visitors/month but your homepage only gets 340. Checked the data.
```

**Why It Works**:
- Curiosity gap drives reading
- Specific numbers build credibility
- Non-threatening question format
- Shows unexpected insight

---

## Hook 4: The Local Angle

**Pattern**: "I'm based in [same city] and noticed [local observation]..."

**Best For**: Local businesses, service providers, brick-and-mortar stores

**Examples**:

```
I'm in Cheltenham too and was checking which homewares stores show up for "homewares Cheltenham" - One Six Eight London wasn't in the top 10 despite your Herald St showroom.
```

```
Fellow Brunswick business here - noticed you're not showing in Google Maps when people search "cafe Brunswick" even though you're on Sydney Road.
```

```
Melbourne-based agency checking local plumbers - your Hawthorn business doesn't appear for "plumber near me" when I'm literally outside your office.
```

**Why It Works**:
- Local connection builds trust
- "We're neighbors" psychology
- Specific geographic proof
- Relatable scenario

---

## Hook 5: The USP Waste

**Pattern**: "You have [amazing feature] but it's invisible when people search [keyword]..."

**Best For**: Businesses with strong differentiators, premium services

**Examples**:

```
You offer a 5-year warranty and price match guarantee, but neither shows up when shoppers search "designer homewares Melbourne" - they're seeing competitors instead.
```

```
Noticed you're Melbourne's only certified [credential] but your site doesn't mention it in search results - checked "best [service] Melbourne" and competitors without your credentials rank higher.
```

```
Your same-day delivery in metro Melbourne is a game-changer, but people searching "furniture delivery Melbourne" see competitors with 5-7 day shipping ranked above you.
```

**Why It Works**:
- Positions them as winners
- Shows they're "close but not quite"
- Highlights competitive advantages
- Creates urgency to fix easy problems

---

## Hook 6: The Mobile/Image Search Discovery

**Pattern**: "Checked your [specific thing] on mobile/Google Images and found [issue]..."

**Best For**: E-commerce, visual products, mobile-heavy industries

**Examples**:

```
Searched Google Images for "modern wall clocks australia" on my phone - 70% of your products don't show up because the images have no descriptions.
```

```
Your website looks great on desktop, but on mobile the menu doesn't work and Google knows it - they're ranking your mobile-friendly competitors higher.
```

```
Typed "luxury vases Melbourne" in Google Images and scrolled through 200 results - didn't see a single One Six Eight London product despite having stunning designs.
```

**Why It Works**:
- Specific search channel (mobile/images)
- Visual/tangible proof
- Often overlooked by businesses
- Easy to verify

---

## Hook 7: The Recent Change/Event

**Pattern**: "Saw you recently [launched/moved/updated] and checked [specific thing]..."

**Best For**: Businesses with recent news, new locations, product launches

**Examples**:

```
Saw you just opened the Cheltenham showroom (congrats!) and checked if it's showing up in "homewares showroom Melbourne" searches - not yet, but easy fix.
```

```
Noticed your new product line launched last month - checked Google Shopping results and none of your products are appearing despite being price-competitive.
```

```
Read about your rebrand on LinkedIn - looked at how it's showing in search results and found the old business name is still ranking higher than the new one.
```

**Why It Works**:
- Timely and relevant
- Shows you're paying attention
- Connects to their current priorities
- Natural reason for outreach

---

## Hook 8: The "I Help [Industry]" Intro

**Pattern**: "I work with [specific industry] businesses in [location] and noticed [observation about their site]..."

**Best For**: When you have industry expertise, niche specialization

**Examples**:

```
I work with designer homewares e-commerce stores in Australia and was analyzing the top 20 - One Six Eight London has the best product photography but the worst search visibility.
```

```
We specialize in local service businesses in Melbourne - ran audits on 50 plumbers and your site has the strongest reviews but weakest Google Business Profile.
```

```
Been helping B2B SaaS companies with organic growth - checked your site against 10 competitors and found you're the only one without comparison pages ("YourProduct vs Competitor").
```

**Why It Works**:
- Establishes expertise immediately
- Shows systematic research
- Positions you as specialist
- Implies you have industry benchmarks

---

## Hook 9: The Question-Based Opening

**Pattern**: "Do you know where [Company] shows up when people search [keyword]?"

**Best For**: Direct tone, time-conscious prospects, consultative approach

**Examples**:

```
Do you know where One Six Eight London appears when Melbourne shoppers search "designer wall clocks"? Page 3, position 24 - checked today.
```

```
Quick question: when someone in Hawthorn Googles "emergency plumber hawthorn" at 2am, does your business show up? Not in the top 3 local pack - verified it.
```

```
Where does your business rank for "best [your category] in [city]"? Checked and you're #8 while competitors with weaker reviews are #1-3.
```

**Why It Works**:
- Direct and respectful of time
- Creates curiosity gap
- Answers own question immediately
- Shows immediate value

## Hook 10: The Referral/Connection Angle

**Pattern**: "A [connection] mentioned [company] - checked your site and found [observation]..."

**Best For**: Warm-ish outreach, when you have mutual connections, community-based

**Examples**:

```
A client asked me about designer homewares stores in Melbourne and mentioned One Six Eight London - checked your site and found a quick opportunity.
```

```
Someone in a Melbourne business group recommended your [service] - looked at your Google presence and noticed you're not ranking for your main keyword.
```

```
Was comparing homewares e-commerce sites for a presentation and One Six Eight London stood out - great products, but search visibility is 70% below industry average.
```

**Why It Works**:
- Warmer introduction
- Social proof (someone knows/recommends them)
- Positive framing
- Reduces cold outreach resistance
