          <strong className="text-navy">LOCAL SEO:</strong>
          <br />
          Local SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) is the practice of tailoring
          your online presence to reach customers in your local area. It ensures
          that your business appears when people are searching for the products
          or services you offer, right when they need them. A quality local SEO
          service provider can help your business get featured in the local
          business section (Google My Business), making it easy for potential
          customers to find and contact you.

          <strong className="text-navy">GOOGLE MY BUSINESS:</strong>
          <br />
          Google My Business (GMB) is a powerful online marketing tool that
          helps businesses get discovered on Google Maps, Local Finder,
          Google&apos;s Local Pack, and organic search results. It showcases
          essential information like your opening hours, photos, location, phone
          number, email address, and more, ensuring customers can easily connect
          with your business.

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>FOR CUSTOMERS:</strong>
          <br />
          Local SEO makes it easy for customers to find products and services
          nearby. Instead of sifting through countless websites to see
          what&apos;s available in their area, they get relevant results right
          away.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>FOR BUSINESSES:</strong>
          <br />
          Local SEO helps businesses appear as relevant results in search
          engines, driving more organic traffic and attracting local customers.
          Because these leads come from people actively searching for what you
          offer, it often leads to higher conversion rates.
