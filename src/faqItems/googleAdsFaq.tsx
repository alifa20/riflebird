    question: "What is PPC?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        <strong>PPC</strong> (Pay Per Click) is a digital marketing strategy
        where advertisers pay a fee each time their ad is clicked. This can
        include anything from banner ads on websites to suggested articles, with
        the most common being paid search results like Google Ads or Bing Ads.

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Google Ads</strong>, formerly known as Google AdWords, are
          clickable ads that appear in search results, resembling organic
          listings. These ads are displayed above organic search and Google My
          Business results, with various targeting options like keywords,
          locations, and user behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
          When multiple businesses bid on the same keyword, Google holds an
          auction to decide which ad gets shown. This is determined by two main
          factors: the maximum bid and the quality score.

        <p className="mb-4">
          With PPC, you pay a fee each time someone clicks on your ad. It
          delivers rapid results, often appearing right after you launch the
          campaign. PPC can be a short-term boost or a long-term marketing
          strategy.

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>SEO:</strong>
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Search engine optimisation (SEO) focuses on organic search results,
          with no cost per click or display. While SEO takes longer to show
          results compared to paid search, it&apos;s considered a long-term strategy
          for sustained growth.

    question: "Why should you use a PPC agency?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        When you partner with a PPC management agency, you gain access to a team
        of marketing professionals dedicated to driving meaningful results for
        your campaign. The agency handles all aspects of your PPC strategy,
        allowing you to focus on your business. This can be a more

        cost.
